|The Role of an Agent that acts on the Economic Operator side during a Procurement Process. Additional information: As per the European Procurement Directives the notion of ï¿½Economic Operatorsï¿½ should be interpreted in a broad manner so as to include any Persons and/or Entities which offer the execution of works, the supply of products or the provision of services on the market, irrespective of the legal form under which they have chosen to operate. Thus, firms, branches, subsidiaries, partnerships, cooperative societies, limited companies, universities, public or private, and other forms of entities than natural Persons should all fall within the notion of Economic Operator, whether or not they are ï¿½Legal Personsï¿½ in all circumstances.

|Statistical data on the Procedure and the Lot. Additional Information At the present time Procurement Procedures are not fully electronic. At a later date, information on the Tenders received could be inferred by the data in the eProcurement System. Therefore this class is temporal and should cease to exist in fully electronic Procurement. The need for its presence responds also to the alignment with the Regulation (EU) 2019/1780 (eForms). Attention will have to be paid in the future to possible inconsistencies derived from data placed in other classes and data held in the Statistical Information class; e.g. the TenderEvaluation class (see eEvaluation diagram) has the attribute admissibileTender indicator, which in case of being false, may enter in contradiction with the highest or lowest Tender value for that very same inadmissible Tender.

Therefore, qualified relations (see hasQualifiedRelation) can be used to represent this relationship on its own and qualify it with additional information such as a date, a place. This is left to implementers. In the case where the purpose is to link the two Requirements without additional information, the simple relationship as proposed here can be directly used.
